And who can blame them? Lovely country, lovely people, lovely science. 

Rebecca Bennett, George Stenhouse and Caisey Pulford have all been over to the land of Maple syrup to attend the 'Taming the BEAST, eh?' course. We're all really excited to hear about what they learned when they return. 

At the same time, Malaka De Silva returned to the University of Manitoba to defend his thesis (spolier alert: he nailed it) and we look forward to welcoming the newly-minted Doctor back to the Bakery once he's done celebrating. Congratulations Malaka!
