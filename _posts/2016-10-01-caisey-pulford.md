backstory: In 2016 I graduated from the University of Liverpool with a first class honours degree in Tropical Disease Biology. My honours project focused on Salmonella prevalence in a collection of venomous snakes and lead to me obtaining the Tropical Disease Biologist of the Year award at graduation. I then received a Wellcome Trust-funded summer internship at the Hinton lab which allowed me to continue this work by using genomic methods to investigate Salmonella diversity in this unusual host. I accepted a PhD in Biological sciences in 2016 funded by the University of Liverpool.
experience: During my PhD, I received the John Lennon Memorial Scholarship for significant contributions towards global health to support my research and was awarded the NOVA prize for significant early contributions in the field of biological sciences.
