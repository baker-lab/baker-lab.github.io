role: George is a PhD student whose project is a study of Shigella in South Africa, using whole genome sequence analysis, with a focus on genetic epidemiology.
backstory: I graduated from the University of Manchester with a BSc. Hons degree in Biomedical science in 2014. I later moved to Belgium to complete a MSc. in Biomedical science- Infectious and Tropical diseases at the University of Antwerp, during which I undertook a research project, at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, studying the changes in the expression of redox balancing genes throughout the Typanosoma brucei life cycle. I then worked as a project manager, back in the UK, for a year before starting my PhD.
factoid: I once saw the Duchess of Cambridge in Kings Cross Station, though no one believes me because she didn’t have any guards with her (that I could see). She was just with, what I assumed to be, her mum.
