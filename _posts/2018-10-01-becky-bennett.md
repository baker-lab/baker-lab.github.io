role: BBSRC Newcastle Liverpool Durham Doctoral Training Partnership PhD student
backstory: In 2018 I graduated from the University of Liverpool with a First-Class Honours Degree in Microbiology where my Honours Project focussed on the genetic dissection of the desKR operon within Staphylococcus aureus. During my time at Liverpool I completed two Summer internships with Dr Malcolm Horsburgh. The first internship was investigating the competition between Staphylococci and its effects upon biofilm formation, in particular S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The second project was the production of a DesR SNP SH1000 S.aureus mutant. I received the Microbiology society’s “Microbiologist of the Year” award in 2017 and graduated with Microbiology prize in 2018. Upon graduating I accepted a BBSRC funded PhD position with Dr Kate Baker at the University of Liverpool within the Functional and Comparative Genomics department.
factoid: I am a descendant of a 17th century pirate who was the lone survivor of a shipwreck off the coast of Cuba. Argh!
