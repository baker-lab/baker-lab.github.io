title: The Bakery represents at the Microbiology Society annual conference 2021 
---

The whole lab attended the Microbiology Society's annual conference and shared our cool ongoing work! We were so grateful to the organisers for accepting both Becky Bengtsson's and Malaka's main projects for oral presentations and Becky Bennett's, George's, and Lewis's work for poster presentations. 

If you have access and want to see our stuff on catch up you'll catch the group's work in the following sessions, or keep you eyes on the website/our twitter feed for the papers as they come to publication:

Becky Bengtsson presented _Informing shigellosis prevention and control through pathogen genomics_ in Public Health Microbiology
Malaka De Silva presented _A tale of two plasmids: contributions of plasmid-associated phenotypes to epidemiological success in Shigella_ in the Secret Life of Mobile Genetic Elements
George Stenhouse presented _Genomic epidemiology of Shigella in South Africa_ in Public Health Microbiology 
Becky Bennett presented _Utilisation of historical isolates to identify key genetic drivers in the long-term success of Shigella as pathogens_ in the Genetics and Genomics Forum 
Lewis Mason presented _Genomic epidemiology of the first London outbreak of antimicrobial resistant sexually transmitted shigellosis_ in Public Health Microbiology 

Congratulations to all the team members on their efforts for the conference and particularly to Lewis Mason who won the Most Promising Poster Prize sponsored by the Journal of Medical Microbiology! 

We had a great time at the conference and were grateful to have the opportunity to network with our sceintific colleagues and discuss our work.  Thank you Micrbiology Society!
