title: The Bakery represents at the Microbiology Society annual conference 2021 
---

The whole lab attended the Microbiology Society's annual conference and we were grateful to the organisers for giving us the opportunity to share our ongoing work. Becky Bengtsson's and Malaka's main projects were both accepted for oral presentations and Becky Bennett's, George's, and Lewis's work were shared as poster presentations. 

If you have access to the catch-up platform and want to see our stuff you'll find the group's work in the following sessions, or keep you eyes on the website/our twitter feed for the papers:

Becky Bengtsson presented _Informing shigellosis prevention and control through pathogen genomics_ in Public Health Microbiology

Malaka De Silva presented _A tale of two plasmids: contributions of plasmid-associated phenotypes to epidemiological success in Shigella_ in the Secret Life of Mobile Genetic Elements

George Stenhouse presented _Genomic epidemiology of Shigella in South Africa_ in Public Health Microbiology 

Becky Bennett presented _Utilisation of historical isolates to identify key genetic drivers in the long-term success of Shigella as pathogens_ in the Genetics and Genomics Forum 

Lewis Mason presented _Genomic epidemiology of the first London outbreak of antimicrobial resistant sexually transmitted shigellosis_ in Public Health Microbiology 

Congratulations to all the team members on their efforts at the conference and particularly to Lewis Mason who won the Most Promising Poster Prize sponsored by the Journal of Medical Microbiology! 

We had a great time at the conference and were grateful to have the opportunity to hear about all the cool stuff everyone is doing, to network with our sceintific colleagues, and discuss our work. Thank you Microbiology Society!
