role: Lewis is a currently working in the group as a research assistant ahead of becoming a PhD student supervised by Dr. Kate Baker and Dr. Claire Jenkins. Surveillance of epidemiological and antimicrobial resistance changes in sexually transmissible enteric infections is his major research interest.
backstory: During my Institute of Biomedical Science (IBMS) accredited degree in [BSc (Hons) Biomedical Science], I specialised in medical microbiology and undertook a research project involving the characterisation of antimicrobial resistance plasmids in enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. Following graduation with First Class Honours and being awarded the Don Whitley Scientific Microbiology Prize in 2019, I commenced study in MSc Infection, Immunity and Human Disease at the University of Leeds, where I specialised in bacteriology and undertook research in characterising antimicrobial resistance proteins in Acinetobacter baumannii and other WHO priority pathogens. I then worked at the University of Liverpool as a research assistant, aiding in the surveillance of epidemiological and antimicrobial resistance changes in sexually transmissible enteric infections and commenced PhD study at the university in December 2020 (funded by the NIHR HPRU in Gastrointestinal Infections). My long-term career goal is to become a higher education lecturer and research associate. 
factoid: I have a passion for French language and culture. My most profound memory is of having an ice-cream, on a hot summerâ€™s day, by the river Seine in Paris.
