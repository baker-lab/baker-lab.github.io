title: Dr. Nicola Love
role: Postdoctoral Research Associate 
backstory: I undertook a PhD at the University of Cambridge on the Wellcome programme in Stem Cell Biology and Medicine and then moved to infectious disease epidemiology, working first as a research assistant in global health while completing a Masters in Public Health and then as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Health Protection and Influenza group, University of Nottingham under Professor Jonathan Van Tam and Dr Richard Puleston (UKHSA). I left academia to join the UK Health Security Agency as a Field Epidemiology Training Programme fellow and remained in UKHSA after my fellowship working as an epidemiologist in the North East, Yorkshire and Humber Field Service (FS) team. While I have a strong interest in GI, my UKHSA work covers surveillance, research and outbreak investigation for all infectious diseases. I am an infectious disease epidemiologist working both as a postdoctoral fellow at the department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology & Immunology, University of Liverpool and as a Senior Epidemiology Scientist at the UK Health Security Agency. My research interests are in the strengthening of infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigation through digital and novel methodologies, with a particular focus on the collection of exposure data. My current research focuses on the epidemiology of foreign travel associated GI infections and aims to better understand the risk factors for acquiring GI infections while abroad. 
factoid: After completing my PhD I spent 9 months travelling from Chicago, USA to Ushuaia, Argentina by motorbike
