role: PhD student co-supervised by Jay Hinton and Kate Baker. My research focuses on using bacterial genomics to understand an epidemic of invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella, estimated to cause 388,000 deaths a year in Africa. Whole genome sequencing is revolutionising the way in which we understand the global dissemination of disease. My ambition is to use these methods to pursue a career focused on the surveillance, evolution and epidemiology of bacterial pathogens during global epidemics.
backstory: In 2016 I graduated from the University of Liverpool with a first class honours degree in Tropical Disease Biology. My honours project focused on Salmonella prevalence in a collection of venomous snakes and lead to me obtaining the Tropical Disease Biologist of the Year award at graduation. I then received a Wellcome Trust-funded summer internship at the Hinton lab which allowed me to continue this work by using genomic methods to investigate Salmonella diversity in this unusual host. I accepted a PhD in Biological sciences in 2016 funded by the University of Liverpool. Since starting my PhD, I have received the John Lennon Memorial Scholarship for significant contributions towards global health to support my research and was awarded the NOVA prize for significant early contributions in the field of biological sciences.
factoid: I was once chased by an elephant for three miles during a research trip to Malawi!
