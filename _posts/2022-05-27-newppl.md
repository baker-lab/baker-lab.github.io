title: Team member update 

---

It's been a really busy year for the Bakery and we've had some updates to the dream team! 

Dr. Becky Bengtsson has moved on to a new job in industry (see alumni page) after finalising her awesome work on the GEMS Shigella, recently published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01054-z">Nature Microbiology</a>

In the meantime, the multitalented Dr. Charlotte Chong has joined the team on an EPSRC funded collaborative wet lab project to validate mathematical models of antimicrobial resistance emergence. In addition to her awesome lab skills, Charlotte has several ongoing bioinformatic projects including being our chief nanopore data expert. 

We're also really lucky to have Dr. Nicola Love join the team half-time as part of the Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Diseases. Nicola is looking into the epidemiology of travel-associated diarrhoeal disease in the UK. 

Welcome to our new team members and best of luck in your next steps Becky JB the first!
