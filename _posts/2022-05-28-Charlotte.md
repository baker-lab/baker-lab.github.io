role: Postdoctoral Research Associate
backstory: I completed both my undergraduate and masterâ€™s degrees in Microbiology at the University of Liverpool. In 2016, I started my BBSRC and Unilever funded PhD project, under the supervision of Dr Mal Horsburgh (University of Liverpool). My studies were focused on the human scalp microbiome. I used metagenomic sequencing to provide insight into the microbes colonising healthy and dandruff scalps. I also performed comparative and population genomic analyses on Staphylococcus capitis isolated from the human scalp. I joined the research group led by Prof. Kate Baker in 2021 funded across both an MRC and EPSRC funded project.
