Becky Bengtsson and Kate travelled to Washington DC to present Becky's early results from analysis of *Shigella* from the Global Enteric Multicentre Study at the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene's annual meeting. 

Becky presented her findings relevant to population structure, antimicrobial resistance and predicted vaccine efficacy based on the genomic analysis of isolates from the study. They were really well received with loads of interest at her poster and great questions from the attendees. 

It was a great conference all round and we then enjoyed a thoroughly engaging visit with our key collaborator Associate Professor Sharon Tennant (who was awarded the Bailey K. Ashford Medal for distinguished work in tropical medicine at the conference - Congratulations Sharon!) at the Centre for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland, Baltimore.  

Awesome work Becky and thanks for hosting us Sharon!
