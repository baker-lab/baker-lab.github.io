Becky Bennett is away from the lab completing a Professional Internship for PhD students, which runs as part of the BBSRC Doctoral Training Program between Liverpool, Newcastle, and Durham.

Becky is enjoying her placement in the IP commercialisation department of the University of Liverpool, getting involved in a wide range of projects, from deciding whether to file for IP protection to helping individuals apply for funding to spin out their IP into a start up to contacting companies to strike potential licensing deals (basically getting a great overview of the technology transfer and IP world).

She also coincidentally participated in the Environment and Microbiology workshop of Biotech Yes! Her team (Hydroot!) won their heat based on a GM root-associated bacteria that will save water in agriculture (and eventually the planet!) The national final is on the 10th of December at the Royal Society. 

We wish Becky and her team mates the best of luck at nationals and look forward to having her back in the lab after Christmas!
