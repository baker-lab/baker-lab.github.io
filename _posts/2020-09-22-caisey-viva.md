Caisey successfully defends her PhD thesis ‘The genomic epidemiology of nontyphoidal <i>Salmonella</i> serovars and their association with invasive disease during enjoyable discussions with her examiners Mal Horsborough and Alison Mather. As if that wasn’t enough, within the same month, she also had her thesis work accepted for publication in Nature Microbiology and landed her dream job at Public Health England! 

We are so happy for Caisey in her success and were mutually delighted to find that we may still have the opportunity to collaborate in her new role!
