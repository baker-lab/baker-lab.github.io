role: I am a postdoctoral research associate working on genomic analyses of Shigella collected from the Global Enteric Multicentre Study (GEMS), a case control study investigating childhood diarrheal diseases at seven high-burden sites in Asia and Africa. My research interests focus on using whole genome sequencing to investigate bacterial evolution and pathogenesis, particularly to gain understanding of the processes that shape genetic diversity among bacterial population, driving disease emergence and spread. 
backstory: I undertook my undergraduate study at the University of Edinburgh in Biological Science (Cell Biology). Upon completion, I commenced my PhD at the Roslin Institute (University of Edinburgh) and joined the Laboratory for Bacterial Evolution and Pathogenesis (LBEP) group, under the supervision of Professor Ross Fitzgerald and Dr Tahar Ait-Ali. My study focused on the obligate intracellular pathogen Lawsonia intracellularis, the aetiological agent of a common non-zoonotic enteric disease in pigs and horses. During my PhD I utilised metagenomic sequencing to acquire draft genome sequences of the bacterium through direct sequencing of clinical samples and performed population genomic analysis.
factoid: I completed the Way of Saint James (the Camino de Santiago) by foot in 2014 along the Northern Way route.
