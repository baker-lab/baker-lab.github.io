We were recently awarded a BBSRC project grant to study _Convergent evolution of Enterobacteriaceae in epidemiological networks with high antimicrobial use_ and are super excited to be working with our long-term collaborators at PHE and the University of Edinburgh Claire Jenkins and Tim Dallman, as well as with Sam Sheppard at the University of Bath, and Jamie Hall down the corridor at the University of Liverpool. 

We will use signatures of convergent evolution among MSM-associated shigellosis outbreaks as a marker for adaptation to transmission among high antimicrobial use environments combining genomic epidemiology, bacterial GWAS, what we have coined 'bulk phenotyping of epidemiological replicates', and experimental evolution to characterise and validate, as well as determine the relative contribution of genetic changes that contribute to the evolution of antimicrobial resistance.  

Congratulations are due to the whole team of investigators on this award and a special thanks goes to Malaka De Silva, who will transition from PDRA to researcher Co-investigator on this project. Malaka is normally based in the wet-lab so when COVID hit, he got sent home and I got sent on secondment. I asked him if he wanted to spend his time at home co-writing a grant I had been working on and he jumped at the opporunity with his typical enthusiasm. 

The hard work certainly paid off, and we're all really excited about getting stuck into this work in the summer!
