During March to August 2020, I was seconded 80% as an external advisor to the Government Office for Science team that convenes the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. It was an absolute honour to work alongside this team and contribute to the pandemic response in this way, and an eye-opening experience into the machinations of science advice and policy. 

I was also so, so proud of my amazing team who continued their work in my absence and essentially just cracked on despite the limited supervision I was able to provide during this time, and the challenges the pandemic posed. Thanks team.
