role: I am investigating the role played by plasmid pKSR100 in driving Shigella epidemics. I am also working on deciphering plasmid dynamics of pKSR100 between different Shigella species as well as other enteric bacteria.
backstory: I completed my Masters degree in Biotechnology For a Sustainable Future from the University of East Anglia in 2011. My dissertation focused on the effect of environmental factors such as salinity, temperature and other stresses on the production of dimethylsulfoniopropionate by dinoflagellate marine plankton Crypthecodinium cohnii and Symbiodinium microadriaticum. After that, I started my PhD in Microbiology at the University of Manitoba in Canada investigating the environmental determinants of antibiotic susceptibility and virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii mainly focusing on Two Component Systems of A. baumannii. In 2019, I joined the research group led by Dr. Kate Baker as a post doctoral research assistant. 
factoid: I have lived in five different countries so far in the past 13 years and loved experiencing different cultures and lifestyles.
