Kate and Becky travelled to Public Health England to present Becky's early results analysing *Shigella* from the Murray Collection. 

As part of a centenary celebration of the National Collection of Type Cultures, Kate presented a talk called 'Standing on the shoulders of giants: Professors Murray and a century of dysentery' which covered a brief history of the role of dysentery in forming the NCTC, the Murray collection of *Enterobacteriaceae* and Becky's early results from new analyses of the collection.

It was a wonderful day celebrating the legacy and achievements of the collection in the last 100 year as well as some great perspectives on the future of the collection. A personal highlight was meeting both Rita Legros and Vicki Hughes who were instrumental in bringing the Murray collection to UK and the early work with the collection. I had no idea they would be there and was a little star struck truth be told. For me it really captured the essence of the day â€“ passing on these important resources through the generations - Becky and I hope to do justice to the legacy they have passed on through the work of the NCTC.
