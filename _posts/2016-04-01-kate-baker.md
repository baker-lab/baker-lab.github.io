role: Kate leads the group ensuring that the strategy is in place to deliver successful outcomes in line with our mission statement and values. This translates to steering our scientific direction, securing adequate resources, finding and appointing awesome people (see below) and providing them with effective guidance and personal development opportunities to achieve the full potential of their projects, group contribution, and personal career trajectories. For more information on my roles outside of leading ‘The Bakery’ please see my full CV <a href="/assets/201007_CV.pdf">here</a>. 
backstory: I qualified as a veterinarian in Australia (BVSc Hons University of Melbourne, 2006) and then practiced in Critical Care and domestic small animal practice before moving to the UK and commencing my PhD at the University of Cambridge and Institute of Zoology, London in 2008 (supervisors- Professors James Wood, Andrew Cunningham and Dr Pablo Murcia, awarded 2012). Originally funded by a Cambridge Infectious Diseases Consortium Junior Research Fellowship I was awarded a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Training Fellowship which ran until 2013. During my PhD I studied viral zoonoses in a common African fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, using a combination of field work, serological, molecular and virological techniques. I then took up a Postdoctoral Fellow position at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (under Professors Nicholas Thomson and Julian Parkhill) working on large-scale genomic epidemiology projects on enteric pathogens (mostly Shigella). In 2014, I was awarded a Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Career Development Fellowship (still current) and moved from the Sanger Institute to the University of Liverpool to start my own group in 2016.  
factoid: One of my top ten life moments was singing ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’ with a Beatles tribute band in the Cavern Club on my hen do.
