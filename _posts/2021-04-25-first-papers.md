title: First lab-led primary analysis papers come out

We are superexcited to have our first lab funded and led primary analysis papers out (on _Shigella_ of course!) 

Becky Bengtsson led supercool analyses looking at the changes in the accessory genome and structural variation that occurred over the course of persistent infections among men who have sex with men and contrasted these with incidences of reinfection. We saw the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance determinants and specific functional signatures for those regions that varied. We also generated a high quality reference genome and biobanked isolate of the clinically important serotype _S. flexneri_ 3a. 

George Stenhouse led the first study characterising _Shigella_ from Malawi by whole genome sequencing. We found that the isolates were perdominately _S. flexneri_ and _S. boydii_ of diverse serotypes and also found plasmid mediated quinolone resistance on a plasmid shared internationally among diverse _Shigella_ serotypes and geographic locations. We're really excited to have started our collaborations with Liverpool-MLW and to have been the home for George's first first-author paper! 

Although we haven't had a chance to get together and celebrate properly yet, both lead authors have received their now-traditional Bakery publication mugs!
