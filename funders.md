	<h4>Funders</h4>
	<p>We are grateful to receive/have received funding from the following sources, which reflects the applied and interdisciplinary nature of our research:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<h5>Wellcome</h5>
			<p>Kate moved to the University of Liverpool with a Clinical Research Career Development Fellowship to look at how the genetic context of AMR impacts its transmission among bacterial populations. She has also been fortunate to receive Wellcome Trust funding indirectly through the University of Liverpool Institutional Stimulus Support Fund and through the Academy of Mecial Sciences Springboard award. Kate is also a co-director on the Liverpool Clinical PhD program for Global Health Priorities in the Global South.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>The Academy of Medical Sciences</h5>
			<p>Kate held a Springboard award from the Academy of Medical Sciences to study multispecies models of AMR transmission. This award funded the beginning of her wet laboratory work.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>The Medical Research Council (UKRI)</h5>
			<p>Kate holds a New Investigator Research Grant to work on analysing large genomic datasets of shigellae from lower and middle income nations to draw out implications for treatment and management. George Stenhouseâ€™s PhD studentship is also funded through the MRC-funded Discovery Medicine North Doctoral Training Partnership.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>The Biotechnology and Biological Resources Council</h5>
			<p>Kate (PI) and Malaka (Researcher CoI) hold a BBSRC Research Grant to study the convergent evolution of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> in high antimicrobial use environments. Becky J Bennett is also funded through a BBSRC NLD Doctoral Training Partnership studentship. Kate is also a CoI on a BBSRC ALERT equipment grant held by Alistair Darby. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>National Institutes for Health Research</h5>
			<p>Kate is a co-investigator on the NIHR funded Health Protection Research Unit on Gastrointestinal Diseases held between the Universities of Liverpool and Warwick and Public Health England. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</h5>
			<p>Kate is a co-investigator on the BMGF funded enterics for global health shigellae surveillance project in Malawi held by Nigel Cunliffe, Khuzwayo Jere, and Jennifer Cornick. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</h5>
			<p> Kate is a co-investigator on a cross-faculty EPSRC funded research grant looking at the evolution of AMR across networks, with Kieran Sharkey (PI) and Karan Pattni (Research CoI) at the Department of Mathematical Sciences. </p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Economics and Social Research Council (UKRI)</h5>
			<p>Kate is a co-investigator on a Grand Challenges Research-Newton Fund project to look at the diseemination of AMR across poultry flocks in India, on which Nicola Williams is the Principal Investigator.</p>
